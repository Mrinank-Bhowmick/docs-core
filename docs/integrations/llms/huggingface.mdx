## Integration Guide

### Chat Completions Calls

<CodeGroup>

```Python python
# Use Portkey Python SDK to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
# Sample Python code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct text call on HuggingFace
# Code example to be added
```

```Node node
// Use Portkey Node.js SDK to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
// Sample Node.js code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct text call on HuggingFace
// Code example to be added
```

```bash cURL
# Use Portkey's REST API to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
# Sample REST API code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct text call on HuggingFace
# Code example to be added
```

```Python OpenAI Python SDK
# Use OpenAI Python SDK to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
# Sample OpenAI SDK Python code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct text call on HuggingFace
# Code example to be added
```

```Node OpenAI Node SDK
// Use OpenAI Node.js SDK to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
// Sample OpenAI SDK Node.js code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct text call on HuggingFace

### Integration via Virtual Key

1. **Generate a Virtual Key**
   Get your API key from HuggingFace and add it to Portkey to create a virtual key.

   You can get your HuggingFace API key from the HuggingFace website [here](https://huggingface.co/login).

   [Insert screenshot of virtual key generation process here]

2. **Using the Virtual Key**

<CodeGroup>

```Python python
# Initialize Portkey with the virtual key in Python
# Sample Python SDK code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct chat completions call on HuggingFace using virtual key
# Code example to be added
```

```Node node
// Initialize Portkey with the virtual key in Node.js
// Sample Node.js SDK code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct chat completions call on HuggingFace using virtual key
// Code example to be added
```

```bash cURL
# Use Portkey's REST API to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
# Sample REST API code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct chat completions call on HuggingFace using virtual key
# Code example to be added
```

```Python OpenAI Python SDK
# Use OpenAI Python SDK to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
# Sample OpenAI SDK Python code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct chat completions call on HuggingFace using virtual key
# Code example to be added
```

```Node OpenAI Node SDK
// Use OpenAI Node.js SDK to make text calls to HuggingFace chat completions models
// Sample OpenAI SDK Node.js code for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct chat completions call on HuggingFace using virtual key
// Code example to be added
```
