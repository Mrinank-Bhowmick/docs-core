</CodeGroup>

### Integration via Virtual Key

1. **Generate a Virtual Key**
   Get your API key from Moonshot and add it to Portkey to create a virtual key.

   You can get your Moonshot API key from the Moonshot website [here](https://www.moonshot.cn/).

   [Insert screenshot of virtual key generation process here]

2. **Using the Virtual Key**

<CodeGroup>

```Python python
# Initialize Portkey with the virtual key in Python
# Sample Python SDK code for moonshot-v1-16k chat completions call on Moonshot using virtual key
# Code example to be added
```

```Node node
// Initialize Portkey with the virtual key in Node.js
// Sample Node.js SDK code for moonshot-v1-16k chat completions call on Moonshot using virtual key
// Code example to be added
```

```bash cURL
# Use Portkey's REST API to make text calls to Moonshot chat completions models like moonshot-v1-16k
# Sample REST API code for moonshot-v1-16k chat completions call on Moonshot using virtual key
# Code example to be added
```

```Python OpenAI Python SDK
# Use OpenAI Python SDK to make text calls to Moonshot chat completions models like moonshot-v1-16k
# Sample OpenAI SDK Python code for moonshot-v1-16k chat completions call on Moonshot using virtual key
# Code example to be added
```

```Node OpenAI Node SDK
