### Integration via Virtual Key

1. **Generate a Virtual Key**
   Get your API key from Cohere and add it to Portkey to create a virtual key.

   You can get your Cohere API key from the Cohere website [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys).

   [Insert screenshot of virtual key generation process here]
