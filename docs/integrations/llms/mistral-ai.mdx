### Integration via Virtual Key

1. **Generate a Virtual Key**
   Get your API key from Mistral and add it to Portkey to create a virtual key.

   You can get your Mistral API key from the Mistral website [here](https://auth.mistral.ai/ui/login).

   [Insert screenshot of virtual key generation process here]
