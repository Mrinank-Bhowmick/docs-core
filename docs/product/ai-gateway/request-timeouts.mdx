description: "Manage unpredictable LLM latencies effectively with Portkey's **Request Timeouts**."

<Check>
  This feature is available on all Portkey [plans](https://portkey.ai/pricing).
</Check>

 This feature allows automatic termination of requests that exceed a specified duration, letting you gracefully handle errors or make another, faster request.

## Enabling Request Timeouts

You can enable request timeouts while **making your request** or you can **set them in Configs**.

Request timeouts are specified in **milliseconds** (`integer)`

### While Making Request

Set request timeout while instantiating your Portkey client or if you're using the REST API, send the `x-portkey-request-timeout` header.

    requestTimeout: 3000

### With Configs

In Configs, request timeouts are set at either (1) strategy level, or (2) target level.

For a 10-second timeout, it will be:

```Bash
"request_timeout": 10000
```

### Setting Request Timeout at Strategy Level


```JSON
{

  "strategy": { "mode": "fallback" },

  "request_timeout": 10000,

  "targets": [

    { "virtual_key": "open-ai-xxx" },

    { "virtual_key": "azure-open-ai-xxx" }

  ]

}
```

Here, the request timeout of 10 seconds will be applied to \* **all**\* the targets in this Config.

### Setting Request Timeout at Target Level

```JSON
{

  "strategy": { "mode": "fallback" },

  "targets": [

    { "virtual_key": "open-ai-xxx", "request_timeout": 10000, },

    { "virtual_key": "azure-open-ai-xxx", "request_timeout": 2000,}

  ]

}
```

Here, for the first target, a request timeout of 10s will be set, while for the second target, a request timeout of 2s will be set.

<Info>
Nested target objects inherit the top-level timeout, with the option to override it at any level for customized control.

</Info>
### How timeouts work in nested Configs


```JSON
{

  "strategy": { "mode": "loadbalance" },

  "request_timeout": 2000,

  "targets": [

    {

      "strategy": { "mode":"fallback" },

      "request_timeout": 5000,

      "targets": [

        {

          "virtual_key":"open-ai-1-1"

        },

        {

          "virtual_key": "open-ai-1-2",

          "request_timeout": 10000

        }

      ],

      "weight": 1

    },

    {

      "virtual_key": "azure-open-ai-1",

      "weight": 1

    }

  ]

}
```

1. We've set a global timeout of **2s** at line #3
2. The first target has a nested fallback strategy, with a top level request timeout of **5s** at line #7
3. The first virtual key (at line #10), the **target-level** timeout of **5s** will be applied
4. For the second virtual key (i.e. `open-ai-1-2`), there is a timeout override, set at **10s**, which will be applied only to this target
5. For the last target (i.e. virtual key `azure-open-ai-1`), the top strategy-level timeout of **2s** will be applied

## Handling Request Timeouts

Portkey issues a standard **408 error** for timed-out requests. You can leverage this by setting up fallback or retry strategies through the `**on_status_codes**` parameter, ensuring robust handling of these scenarios.

### Triggering Fallbacks with Request Timeouts

```JSON
{

  "strategy": {

    "mode": "fallback",

    "on_status_codes": [408]

  },

  "targets": [

    { "virtual_key": "open-ai-xxx", "request_timeout": 2000, },

    { "virtual_key": "azure-open-ai-xxx"}

  ]

}
```

Here, fallback from OpenAI to Azure OpenAI will only be triggered if the first request times out after 2 seconds, otherwise the request will fail with a 408 error code.

### Triggering Retries with Request Timeouts

```JSON
{

    "request_timeout": 1000,

    "retry": { "attempts": 3, "on_status_codes": [ 408 ] },

    "virtual_key": "open-ai-xxx"

}
```

Here, retry is triggered upto 3 times whenever the request takes more than 1s to return a response. After 3 unsuccessful retries, it will fail with a 408 code.

[Here's a general guide on how to use Configs in your requests.](/docs/product/ai-gateway/configs)

### Caveats and Considerations

While the request timeout is a powerful feature to help you gracefully handle unruly models & their latencies, there are a few things to consider:

1. Ensure that you are setting reasonable timeouts - for example, models like `gpt-4` often have sub-10-second response times
2. Ensure that you gracefully handle 408 errors for whenever a request does get timed out - you can inform the user to rerun their query and setup some neat interactions on your app
3. For streaming requests, the timeout will not be triggered if it gets **atleast a chunk** before the specified duration.
